As for me, the only thing You will need to know is that I am driven. I spent countless off-work hours learning and excelling just to be a better engineer. Partly because I genuinely like what I do. But above all, I believe that discipline and work ethic is the key to success. Lastly, one can find my most significant projects in the projects section of this resume and on GitHub."
